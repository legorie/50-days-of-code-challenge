[100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) is an initiative I wanted to take but given my commitments are work and home, I took the liberty to divide the initial number by the number of kids I'm bless with to make it a 50 day challenge.

My goal is to learn the Go language better and contribute to an Open Souce program which I've been following since 3 months. For now, I'm not able to make heads or tails about of the K8S Operator written in Go, hopefully at the end of this #50-days-of-code-challenge it would make things better.

[100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) is an initiative I wanted to take but given my commitments are work and home, I took the liberty to divide the initial number by the number of kids I'm bless with to make it a 50 day challenge.

My goal is to learn the Go language better and contribute to an Open Souce program which I've been following since 3 months. For now, I'm not able to make heads or tails about of the K8S Operator written in Go, hopefully at the end of this #50-days-of-code-challenge it would make things better.

- Had a good experience with my favorite OpenSouce project KubeArmor. I saw an issue which I had the knowledge to help, Issue [#942](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/issues/942) - Helm installation not working. I quickly downloaded the repo, installed the Helm chart, replicated the issue. Luckily, was able to figure it out to (it was a good-first-issue), fixed it by comparing it with the correct REPO URLs in other deployment methods and was ready to submit my request to pick the issue. Then, I noticed that another contributor had already submitted the fix via another PR. My first work trying to contribute went in vain but I learn that I could help and contribute & more importantly my solution match with that of the contributor. I felt good with my first try; miles to go before I could really add value to the project.
